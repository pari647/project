        <h1>Happy Holi</h1>
        <p>Holi, also known as the "Festival of Colors,
            " is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrated 
            primarily in India and Nepal. It marks the 
            arrival of spring, the triumph of good
             over evil, and the divine love between
              Radha and Krishna. Celebrations involve 
              throwing colored powder and water on each 
              other, dancing, singing, and enjoying 
              traditional sweets.</p>
